# bill length, island and species
#  - Adelie lives in all the three islands.
#  - Gentoo only in Biscoe.
#  - Chinstrap only in Dream.
#  - Gentoo and Chinstrap have lengthier bills compared to Adelie
# Biscoe island is the only island with Gentoo penguins. Since thereâ€™s no causal relationship established,
# we can only infer that flipper length differences over islands may come from the fact that there are
# differences between species, and certain species tend to live on certain islands. 
# We would need to conduct controlled experiments to conclude that the island is indeed a confounding variable.

# Gentoo pengiuns can be distingushed from the other species using flipper length (possibly other features too?).   
# However, we only have examples of Gentoo penguins that live on Biscoe island. So Biscoe island is a cofounding
# variable. It could be that some local aspect of the island (for example, environmental pressures) have led to the
# penguins having reduced flipper length that may not be shared by populations of Gentoo pengiuns living elsewhere.
