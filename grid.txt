Exhuastive test of combinations... 

Mean of random sets 1 to 10, from best result of each of the grid 

logistic regression 98.09%
random forest 97.05%
knn 97.5%
my svm 99.09%  - over 100 random sets, 98.36%


unbalanced
----------
knn robust
logistic regression not
random forest robust
svm can be affected

k-means inbalance not relevant


Standardize necessary?
